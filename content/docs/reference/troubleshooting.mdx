# Troubleshooting Magma Servers

This guide covers common issues that you might encounter when running a Magma server, along with their solutions. If you're experiencing problems not addressed here, please check our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/magma) or [GitHub issues](https://github.com/magmafoundation/Magma-Neo/issues).

## Server Startup Issues

### Server Won't Start

**Symptoms:** The server fails to start, terminal closes immediately, or you see a "Java not found" error.

**Possible Causes and Solutions:**

1. **Java not installed correctly**
   - Make sure you have Java 21 or newer installed
   - Verify with: `java -version`
   - Install from [Adoptium](https://adoptium.net/) if needed

2. **Incorrect Java version**
   - Magma requires Java 21 or newer
   - If using multiple Java versions, specify the path in your start script

3. **Insufficient permissions**
   - Ensure you have permissions to execute the JAR file
   - Try running as administrator/sudo

4. **Corrupted Magma JAR file**
   - Re-download the Magma server JAR file or launcher
   - Verify file integrity with SHA-256 checksum
   
5. **Using launcher vs installer**
   - For versions 1.40-beta and above, you can use either the launcher or installer
   - The launcher is the server JAR itself with built-in setup functionality
   - If one doesn't work, try the other installation method

### EULA Not Accepted

**Symptoms:** Server starts but immediately shuts down with an EULA message.

**Solution:**
1. Open `eula.txt` in your server directory
2. Change `eula=false` to `eula=true`
3. Save the file and restart the server

### Port Already in Use

**Symptoms:** You see "Address already in use" or "Failed to bind to port" errors.

**Solutions:**
1. **Check for running Minecraft servers**
   - Use `netstat -ano | grep 25565` (Linux/macOS) or `netstat -ano | findstr 25565` (Windows)
   - Stop any processes using port 25565 (or your chosen port)

2. **Change the port**
   - Edit `server-port` in `server.properties`
   - Choose a different port like 25566

### Crash on Startup

**Symptoms:** Server crashes during startup with stack trace errors.

**Solutions:**

1. **Check logs**
   - Examine `logs/latest.log` for specific error messages
   - Look for mod/plugin conflicts or missing dependencies

2. **Mod/Plugin conflicts**
   - Start with no mods/plugins, then add them one by one
   - Check compatibility of mods with your Minecraft version

3. **Memory issues**
   - Increase allocated memory in your startup script (e.g., `-Xmx4G` for 4GB)
   - Ensure your system has enough available RAM

4. **File corruption**
   - Delete the `libraries` folder (Magma will redownload it)
   - Try a fresh Magma installation

## Runtime Issues

### Server Lag

**Symptoms:** High latency, block placement lag, TPS drops, or choppy gameplay.

**Solutions:**

1. **Check TPS**
   - Use `/magma tps` to check server TPS (should be close to 20)
   - Use `/timings` or Spark plugin for detailed performance analysis

2. **Reduce view distance**
   - Lower `view-distance` in `server.properties` (try 8-10)
   - Reduce `simulation-distance` (try 5-6)

3. **Entity management**
   - Use `/magma entities` to see entity counts
   - Install entity management plugins like ClearLagg
   - Adjust spawn rates in `bukkit.yml`

4. **Optimize JVM flags**
   - Use G1GC garbage collector (see our [Optimization Guide](/docs/guides/optimization))
   - Allocate appropriate memory (don't over-allocate)

5. **Investigate mods/plugins**
   - Disable mods/plugins one by one to identify performance issues
   - Update to latest versions

### World Generation Lag

**Symptoms:** Lag when players explore new areas or teleport long distances.

**Solutions:**

1. **Pre-generate worlds**
   - Use plugins like Chunky or WorldBorder to pre-generate chunks
   - Set a world border to limit exploration

2. **Optimize world settings**
   - Reduce `spawn-limits` in `bukkit.yml`
   - Adjust entity activation ranges in `spigot.yml`

### Memory Leaks

**Symptoms:** RAM usage continuously increases until the server crashes.

**Solutions:**

1. **Monitor memory**
   - Use `/magma heap` to monitor memory usage
   - Install plugins like Spark for detailed memory analysis

2. **Identify problematic mods/plugins**
   - Start with minimal mods/plugins and add them back gradually
   - Check for outdated mods/plugins known to cause memory leaks

3. **Adjust JVM flags**
   - Add `-XX:+UseG1GC -XX:+ParallelRefProcEnabled` to your startup script
   - Consider setting `-Xms` equal to `-Xmx` to prevent heap resizing

4. **Regular restarts**
   - Schedule regular server restarts using a server wrapper
   - Use a plugin like AutoRestart for timed restarts

## Mod and Plugin Issues

### Mod Not Loading

**Symptoms:** Mod appears in logs but doesn't function, or doesn't appear in `/magma mods`.

**Solutions:**

1. **Check mod compatibility**
   - Verify the mod is for your exact Minecraft version
   - Ensure it's built for NeoForge (not Fabric or older Forge)

2. **Missing dependencies**
   - Look for "missing dependency" errors in logs
   - Install required library mods and dependencies

3. **Mod conflicts**
   - Try loading the mod alone to check for conflicts
   - Check mod configuration files for errors

### Plugin Not Loading

**Symptoms:** Plugin doesn't appear in `/plugins` list or commands don't work.

**Solutions:**

1. **Check compatibility**
   - Ensure the plugin is compatible with your Minecraft version
   - Check if it's designed for Bukkit/Spigot/Paper

2. **Check dependencies**
   - Look for dependency errors in server logs
   - Install required dependency plugins (e.g., Vault, ProtocolLib)

3. **API compatibility**
   - Some plugins may use API features not supported in Magma
   - Try alternative plugins with similar functionality

### Conflict Between Mods and Plugins

**Symptoms:** Server crashes, unexpected behavior, or features not working when certain mods and plugins are used together.

**Solutions:**

1. **Identify the conflict**
   - Disable mods and plugins one by one to isolate the conflict
   - Check logs for interaction errors

2. **Check for feature overlap**
   - Mods and plugins doing the same thing often conflict
   - Use either the mod or plugin version, not both

3. **Look for compatibility patches**
   - Some mods have patches or configurations for compatibility
   - Check mod/plugin documentation for known issues

## Database Issues

### Database Connection Failures

**Symptoms:** Plugins that use databases fail to start or throw database connection errors.

**Solutions:**

1. **Check database server**
   - Ensure your MySQL/MariaDB/etc. server is running
   - Verify network access to the database server

2. **Verify credentials**
   - Double-check username, password, and database name
   - Ensure the database user has necessary permissions

3. **Connection settings**
   - Check host/port settings in plugin configurations
   - Try using IP address instead of hostname

## Network Issues

### Can't Connect to Server

**Symptoms:** Players receive "Connection refused" or timeout errors when joining.

**Solutions:**

1. **Check server status**
   - Verify the server is running with no errors
   - Check if you can connect locally with `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`

2. **Port forwarding**
   - Ensure port 25565 (or your custom port) is forwarded to your server
   - Check your router's port forwarding settings
   - Verify with an online port checking tool

3. **Firewall settings**
   - Allow Java and Minecraft server through Windows Firewall
   - Check iptables rules on Linux
   - Disable restrictive antivirus temporarily for testing

### Timeouts and Disconnections

**Symptoms:** Players frequently get disconnected or experience timeouts.

**Solutions:**

1. **Network stability**
   - Check your internet connection stability
   - Try a wired connection instead of Wi-Fi for the server

2. **Server performance**
   - High server lag can cause timeouts
   - Follow performance optimization guidelines

3. **Reduce network load**
   - Decrease `max-players` to reduce bandwidth requirements
   - Adjust `network-compression-threshold` in `server.properties`

## File and Permission Issues

### World Corruption

**Symptoms:** Chunks missing, blocks resetting, or "Level file cannot be read" errors.

**Solutions:**

1. **Restore from backup**
   - Always maintain regular backups
   - Restore from the most recent clean backup

2. **Chunk regeneration**
   - Use plugins like WorldEdit to regenerate corrupted chunks
   - Be aware this will reset those chunks to newly generated state

3. **Prevention**
   - Use proper server shutdown with `/stop` command
   - Avoid killing the server process abruptly
   - Use a UPS for power protection

### Permission Denied Errors

**Symptoms:** "Access denied" or "Permission denied" errors in logs.

**Solutions:**

1. **File permissions**
   - Ensure the user running the server has write access to the server directory
   - Linux: `chmod -R 755 /path/to/server` and `chown -R username:username /path/to/server`

2. **Server directory location**
   - Avoid running the server from protected directories
   - Use a dedicated directory with proper permissions

## Advanced Troubleshooting

### Generating Debug Reports

For complex issues, generate debug information:

1. **Timings report**
   ```
   /timings on
   # Wait at least 5 minutes during normal server usage
   /timings paste
   ```

2. **Spark profiler**
   ```
   /spark profiler --timeout 60
   ```

3. **Thread dump**
   ```
   # From console
   dump
   ```

### Reaching Out for Help

When seeking help on Discord or GitHub:

1. Provide your Magma version and Minecraft version
2. Include relevant logs (latest.log, crash reports)
3. List all mods and plugins you're using
4. Describe steps to reproduce the issue
