# Troubleshooting

## Server Won't Start

- **Java not found**: Install Java 21+ from [Adoptium](https://adoptium.net/). Verify with `java -version`.
- **EULA not accepted**: Set `eula=true` in `eula.txt`.
- **Port in use**: Change `server-port` in `server.properties` or stop the process using port 25565.
- **Corrupted JAR**: Re-download from the [downloads page](/downloads).
- **Crash on startup**: Check `logs/latest.log`. Try removing all mods/plugins and adding them back one at a time.

## Performance

- **Lag/low TPS**: Lower `view-distance` (8-10) and `simulation-distance` (5-6) in `server.properties`. See the [optimization guide](/docs/guides/optimization).
- **World gen lag**: Pre-generate chunks with [Chunky](https://modrinth.com/plugin/chunky) and set a world border.
- **Memory leaks**: Monitor with Spark. Schedule regular restarts. Set `-Xms` equal to `-Xmx`.

## Mods & Plugins

- **Mod not loading**: Check it matches your Minecraft version and is built for NeoForge (not Fabric/old Forge). Check logs for missing dependencies.
- **Plugin not loading**: Check it's compatible with Bukkit/Spigot API. Check logs for dependency errors.
- **Mod/plugin conflict**: Disable one at a time to isolate. Avoid running mods and plugins that do the same thing.

## Connectivity

- **Can't connect**: Verify the server is running, port 25565 is forwarded, and your firewall allows Java.
- **Timeouts**: Check network stability. High server lag can also cause disconnects.

## Common Errors

| Error | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| `Failed to bind to address` | Port already in use. Change port or stop the other process. |
| `Error occurred during initialization of VM` | Bad JVM args or not enough RAM. Reduce `-Xmx`. |
| `Could not reserve enough space for object heap` | Allocating more RAM than available. Lower `-Xmx`. |
| `NoSuchMethodError` / `ClassNotFoundException` | Mod/plugin version mismatch. Update or remove it. |
