# Magma API Documentation

This page provides technical documentation for developers who want to create or adapt plugins and mods for Magma. Magma provides unique capabilities by bridging the Bukkit and NeoForge APIs, allowing for interesting integrations between the two ecosystems.

## Understanding Magma's Architecture

Magma's architecture consists of three main components:

1. **Minecraft Server Core**: The base Minecraft server code
2. **NeoForge Implementation**: Handles mod loading and execution
3. **Bukkit/Spigot Implementation**: Handles plugin loading and execution

Magma works by mapping Bukkit's API calls to Minecraft's codebase, while also applying NeoForge's modifications and hooks. This creates a hybrid environment where both systems can coexist.

> **Note:** If you're looking for documentation on the Magma website API (for accessing version information programmatically), please see the [Website API documentation](/docs/reference/website-api).

## Plugin and Mod API Development

This section covers the development of plugins and mods for Magma. Additional documentation will be added in upcoming updates, including:

- Detailed Bukkit plugin development for Magma
- NeoForge mod development with Magma compatibility
- Cross-platform entity and item conversion
- Event handling between Bukkit and NeoForge
- Performance optimization tips
- Compatibility considerations for plugins and mods

If you have specific questions or topics you'd like to see covered, please join our [Discord community](https://discord.gg/magma) or open an issue on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/magmafoundation/Magma-Neo).

In the meantime, you can refer to the standard [Bukkit API documentation](https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/bukkit/) and [NeoForge documentation](https://neoforged.net/) for basic development guidance.
