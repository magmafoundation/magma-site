# Adding Mods

Magma runs NeoForge mods. Make sure mods match your Minecraft version.

## Where to Find Mods

- [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods)
- [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mods)

Check that each mod supports your Minecraft version and is built for NeoForge.

## Installing

1. Stop your server
2. Drop the `.jar` into the `mods` folder
3. Start the server

```bash
cp ~/downloads/some-mod.jar ~/server/mods/
```

## Configuration

Mods generate config files in the `config` folder on first run. Stop the server, edit the config, restart.

## Dependencies

If a mod fails to load, check `logs/latest.log` for missing dependency errors. Download and add the required library mods to your `mods` folder.

## Updating

1. Stop server
2. Back up `mods` and `config` folders
3. Remove old `.jar`, add new one
4. Start server

## Troubleshooting

- **Mod not loading** — wrong Minecraft version, missing dependency
- **Crash on startup** — check `logs/latest.log`, try removing the mod to isolate the issue
- **Conflicts with plugins** — if a mod and plugin do the same thing, pick one
