# Adding Plugins

Magma supports Bukkit, Spigot, and Paper plugins. Make sure they match your Minecraft version.

## Where to Find Plugins

- [SpigotMC](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/)
- [Hangar](https://hangar.papermc.io/)
- [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/plugins)

## Installing

1. Stop your server
2. Drop the `.jar` into the `plugins` folder
3. Start the server

```bash
cp ~/downloads/some-plugin.jar ~/server/plugins/
```

The plugin creates its config in `plugins/<PluginName>/`.

## Configuration

Most plugins use YAML (`.yml`) config files. Use spaces, not tabs. Edit with the server stopped, or use the plugin's `/reload` command.

## Common Plugins

- **LuckPerms** — permissions
- **EssentialsX** — general admin tools
- **WorldGuard** — region protection
- **Vault** — economy/permissions API (required by many plugins)
- **Spark** — performance profiling

## Dependencies

Some plugins need other plugins to work (e.g. Vault, ProtocolLib, PlaceholderAPI). Check logs for missing dependency errors.

## Updating

1. Stop server
2. Back up `plugins` folder
3. Replace the old `.jar`
4. Start server

## Troubleshooting

- **Plugin not loading** — wrong MC version, missing dependency, or uses unsupported API
- **Commands not working** — check `/plugins` to see if it's loaded, check permissions
- **Conflicts with mods** — disable one at a time to isolate the issue
