# Adding Bukkit Plugins to Magma

One of Magma's major advantages is its ability to run Bukkit plugins alongside NeoForge mods. This guide will show you how to add and manage Bukkit plugins on your Magma server.

## Understanding Plugin Compatibility

Before adding plugins, it's important to understand:

- Magma supports Bukkit, Spigot, and Paper plugins
- Plugins must be compatible with your Minecraft version
- Some plugins may conflict with certain mods or other plugins

## Finding Compatible Plugins

Good sources for Bukkit plugins include:

- [SpigotMC](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/)
- [Bukkit Dev](https://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins)
- [Polymart](https://polymart.org/)
- [Hangar](https://hangar.papermc.io/)

Always check that the plugin:
- Supports your exact Minecraft version
- Is designed for Bukkit/Spigot (Paper plugins usually work too)
- Has received recent updates or is confirmed working with current versions

## Installing Plugins

### Basic Installation

1. Download the plugin's `.jar` file
2. Stop your Magma server if it's running
3. Place the `.jar` file in the `plugins` folder in your server directory
4. Start your server

Example terminal commands:

```bash
# Copy plugin to plugins folder
cp ~/downloads/essential-plugin-1.0.jar ~/minecraft-server/plugins/
# Start server
cd ~/minecraft-server
./run.sh
```

### First-Time Plugin Setup

When you add a plugin for the first time:

1. The plugin will create its configuration files in the `plugins/<PluginName>` directory
2. Review the plugin's configuration files
3. Make any necessary adjustments
4. Use plugin commands to complete setup (if required)

## Plugin Configuration

Most plugins create a configuration folder with files in the `plugins` directory:

```
plugins/
  ├── PluginName.jar
  └── PluginName/
      ├── config.yml
      ├── data.yml
      └── messages.yml
```

### Editing Configuration Files

To configure a plugin:

1. Stop your server (recommended for important configs)
2. Edit the configuration files with a text editor
3. Start your server again

Most plugins use YAML (.yml) format for configuration. Make sure to:
- Maintain proper indentation
- Don't use tabs (use spaces instead)
- Keep the same formatting structure

### In-Game Configuration

Many plugins also offer in-game configuration through commands:

```
/pluginname reload  - Reload the plugin's configuration
/pluginname set option value  - Change a configuration option
/pluginname help  - Show available commands
```

## Essential Plugin Categories

Here are some essential plugin categories for most servers:

### Administration Plugins

- **Permission Management**: LuckPerms, PermissionsEx
- **Moderation Tools**: EssentialsX, CoreProtect
- **Anti-Cheat**: NoCheatPlus, Matrix

### Gameplay Enhancement

- **Economy**: Vault, EssentialsX
- **Land Protection**: GriefPrevention, Towny, WorldGuard
- **Custom Commands**: EssentialsX, CommandPanels

### Performance and Utility

- **Optimization**: ClearLag, Chunky
- **Backups**: DriveBackupV2
- **Monitoring**: Spark, Plan

## Managing Plugin Dependencies

Some plugins require other plugins to function. Common dependencies include:

- **Vault**: API for economy, permissions, and chat
- **ProtocolLib**: Library for packet manipulation
- **PlaceholderAPI**: Framework for text variables and placeholders

When a plugin requires a dependency, you'll see errors in your server logs if it's missing. Install the dependency plugin just like any other plugin.

## Updating Plugins

To update plugins:

1. Stop your server
2. Backup your server files (especially the `plugins` folder)
3. Remove the old plugin `.jar` file
4. Add the new plugin `.jar` file
5. Start your server
6. Check logs for any issues

### Configuration After Updates

After updating a plugin:
1. Check if the configuration format has changed
2. Look for any new configuration options
3. Use the plugin's reload command if available (e.g., `/pluginname reload`)

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Plugin Not Loading

If a plugin isn't loading, check:
1. Server logs for error messages
2. If the plugin is for the correct Minecraft version
3. If all required dependencies are installed

### Commands Not Working

If plugin commands aren't working:
1. Check if the plugin is properly enabled (`/plugins` command)
2. Verify the command syntax
3. Ensure you have the correct permissions

### Plugin Conflicts

If plugins conflict with each other or with mods:
1. Check logs for error messages
2. Try disabling plugins one by one to identify the conflict
3. Look for alternative plugins that provide similar functionality
4. Check the plugin's documentation or support channels for known issues

## Advanced: Plugin Management

For servers with many plugins, consider these management practices:

### Organized Plugin Structure

Create a clear organizational structure:
- Group related plugins (economy, protection, utilities)
- Document dependencies
- Keep a spreadsheet of plugins, versions, and configurations

### Using Plugin Managers

Some meta-plugins can help manage your plugin ecosystem:
- **PlugMan**: Enables reloading plugins without server restarts
- **ServerUtils**: Provides advanced server and plugin management

### Creating Custom Plugin Packs

For consistent server deployments:
1. Create a standardized set of plugins
2. Maintain configuration templates
3. Use scripts to deploy and configure plugins automatically
